# PersonalExpenseDashboard

Background & Context:
This project is my first personal project which I have planned myself to showcase some skills I have learned during programming.
I have completed the IBM Data Science Professional certificate on Coursera and have learned Python, SQL, seaborn, matplotlib and other libraries.
The best way to keep my skills sharp and to show others what I have learned is by creating programs and projects like this one to reinforce what I've learned.

The project:
The aim of the project is to successfully build an expense tracker, a script or an app which takes in expenses through a csv, excel or manual input and and generates monthly summaries of budget and actual expense including categories. There should be visualisations such as pie charts and line charts. 

Techincal Tools and Skills:
Pandas, Matplotlib / Plotly.

I am already in the habit of planning my monthly budget. What I need is bank statements from previous months and add that into a csv or spreadsheet.

The first iteration of this project has been completed on 04 August 2025. Improvements have been suggested and I'm awaiting feedback from my mentor to find any other improvements.

I really enjoyed creating this project as it tested my understanding of pandas dataframes and the use of matplotlib. I also understood the value of conciseness and during development, I ended up having too many graphs and charts which didn't really give extra value. Understanding this flaw and reducing the clutter creates value and makes it easier to view the information.
